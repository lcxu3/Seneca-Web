<p> 
<dfn> The monarch butterfly is a milkweed butterfly in the family of the Nymphalidae.</dfn>
The monarch butterfly has other names the are common tiger, milkweed and the wanderer. 
This butterfly is most known in North America and it is a very iconic species called the pollinator species.
Also, the most known colours of wings for this species are black, orange and white. 
Their wingspan can be about 7 to 10.2 centimetres long.
A little bit about the history of the Monarch butterfly how it got this name and I am going to tell you.
It got the name of king Willam the third of England.
The reason, why the main colour is orange, is that it is known as the prince of orange. 
The population of these species has been declining over years by 90 percent since the 1990s. 
Their ecosystem has been lost due to crops, loss of habits, king native nectar plants by pesticides and cities developments.

   <h1>  Spritual and Diets on the Monarch butterfly</h1>
   <p> 
    Butterflies are also spiritual and you may be wondering why well I am going to tell you.
    First, like humans butterflies also have birth, life, death and transformation. 
    Another way it can represent the evolution from one lifetime to the next. 
    these species are like a compass kind of like a guiding light to know which directions to go and it will point it to us.
    It can guide you in your life or just part of your journey.
    Everyone looks at the spiritual ways of these butterflies differently since everyone has different ways of interpreting them.
    Monarch butterflies each have different diets from when they were from a caterpillar to an adult.
     The caterpillar mostly feeds on the leaves of the milkweed, wildflowers.
     As a fully grown adults, they will start to feed off from nectars of native flowers and different varieties of plants. 
     They will contuine to eat milkweed.

<h3> FUN FACTS</h3>
<p>  
    Here are some very interesting facts about the Monarch butterfly that you may not know. 
    They know how to commute with each other by their scents and their colours. 
    Another fact is the way how males can attract females by using chemicals from their wings. 
    Which is something that I found very cool about these butterflies.
    When they are endangered they use their bright wings colours as a warning to their predators and they should attack at their own risk.
    Their wings can also send signals to each other due to their bright colours of wings as well when they are being positioned.

<h2> Migrating</h2>
<p> 
    When it comes to Migrating in the fall many butterflies are seen and they can cover up to thousands of miles and return to the north.
    In the late summer to fall, they will migrate from the northern and central of the United States, Canada to Flordia and Mexico.
    During the winter they will migrate from western North America in the Rocky Mountains and from California to Mexico. 
    Also, there is no difference between migrating and non-migtrating Monarch butterfly.
</p>
<br>

<h2> Gentics</h2>
<p>
  In terms of genetics, there are 16806 protein-coding genes with 273 million base pair drafts. 
  What I mean by pair draft is the way in how male and female mate.
  The difference between expressed of these butterflies is their microRNA between the seasons and one of them is summer.
  Not all genetics exist between eastern and western North America.

Let's start talking about the different steps in order to become an egg to a butterfly.  
The eggs of course come from laying the eggs on the underside of a leaf from milkweed during the spring and summer seasons. 
They lay around 300 to 500 eggs over a 2 to 5 weeks period. 
 The size of the egg is about 9mm and weighs about 0.5mg and it will take 3 to 5 days to develop into a larva. 
The larva has 5 stages and I going to give a short summary for each of them. 
Stage one is called the first instar. which have a pale green or sometimes a greyish white colour. 
It's very shiny and translucent with a large black head that feeds off milkweed and it has circular movement. 
Grows between 2 to 6mm long.
Stage two is called the second instar. 
which have a pattern of white, yellow and black that are shaped like a triangle and it has 2 sets of pairs. 
Which covers the pairs of black tentacles.
 Grows between 6mm to 1 cm long. 
Stage three is called the third instar. 
The tentacles become longer and it fed on cutting movement on the leaf edges. grows between 1 to 1.5cm long. 
Stage four is called the fourth instar. 
Smaller pair near the head and larger pair need the back. 
Which has a banding pattern and it is developing white spots neat its back. grows between 1.5cm to 2.5cm long.
 The fifth stage is called the fifth instar. 
It has an even more complex branding pattern and white spots from the front legs to the head. 
It chews on a shallow notch of the leaf while eating. grows between 2.5 to 4.5cm long. 
The pupa is a cocoon of a caterpillar and is a safe place for them that spins the silk downward-facing horizontally. 
This will be a j-shaped hanging up to 12 to 16 hours.
 The colour is pale green with a golden dot neat the bottom and a gold black rim around the top. 
During the beginning, it will be soft and later it hardened thought the day. during the day it will be 2.5cm long and 10-12 mm wide the weight is about 1.2g.
 The last step is the adult is the final step where it will become a fully grown butterfly.
